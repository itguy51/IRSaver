Hi, I'm an owner of a Retina MacBook Pro!
My laptop has Image Retention issues, and I would like to offer my little
bit of code to all of you IR haters.

What is it?

Well, it's pretty simple. 
It's just a window that changes colors every 2 seconds. It'll sit on top
of everything and makes the title bar get out of the way to let you do so.

Why does the dock hide??
Apple has weird restrictions where I can't hide the title bar without
hiding the dock.

How to use:

Resize, move and go. it'll stay on top. Anywhere that doesn't resize it
moves it.

WARNING!!!

THIS APPLICATION UTILIZES CHANGING COLORS. IF YOU HAVE EPILEPSY PLEASE DO
NOT USE THIS APPLICATION.

I have tried to pick an interval that keeps even the worst of IR out,
and hopefully won't trigger epileptic seizures. 

Other side notes:

My friend has used this application and has noted that it fixed a dead pixel.
YMMV, but hey, it's something to put on the list of features.

Also, this code is licensed under the 2-clause BSD license because if you
honestly have a need for a random color-changing piece of software in your
proprietary software then I'm not going to question it.

(However, if you do use it in that manner, I'd love to know what you're
using it for)
